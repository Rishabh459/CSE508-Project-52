Problem Statement-
Reading the news online has exploded as the web provides access to millions of news sources worldwide. The sheer volume of articles can be overwhelming to readers.
A key challenge of a news service website is to help users find news articles that match their interests.
Personalised News Recommendation is advantageous to both users and the news service, as the user can quickly find what he or she needs and the news service to help retain and increase the customer base.

Proposed Solution-
Creating a personalised news recommendation system that considers users' interests based on their tweets and recommends relevant articles. Most users use Twitter to get daily updates on what is happening, and our model helps them get personalised news articles that they might like or might be looking for. For the model implementation, we can use different information retrieval techniques.
