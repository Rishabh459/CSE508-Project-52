# Information Retrieval using Inverted Indices

In this implementation, we have built an inverted index from scratch. 
We have used a DataBase with 1400 files to get a substantial corpus to work with.
Run the python source file name application.py to drive the System.


A detailed report with the name Report.pdf will be covering our methodologies, assumptions, and results.
